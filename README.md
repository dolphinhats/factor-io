## Currently work in progress (WIP)

Current design ideas:

	- Create Factorio Lua mod which triggers events in another Lua script that is running on top of a Java listener class.
	- Incorperate bi-directional communication for both environment pooling and also environment control.
	  - Possibly implement an in-game item which supports wire IO.
